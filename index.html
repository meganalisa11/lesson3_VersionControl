            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Why version control systems? Fundamentally, they are here to help. There are a lot of occupations that may utilize version control systems for their benefits, but program developers are common version control users. Although they are common, any person with the need to efficiently keep up with a large amount of different versions of files can reap the advantages. That is where these VCSs come into play because they make it easy not only to share files but also to keep a history of all the previous versions of those files which can be reverted, checked, edited, or a whole list of other useful benefits that comes with using these systems. In a work environment, VCSs help foster seamless project collaboration and that is why they are used in frequent. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Programming is quite a unique job to have. Although work is work, programming does end up entailing different aspects than a construction job, for instance. While construction workers are building with steel and jackhammers, programmers are building computer programs with files and codes and a lot of them at that. That is why when it comes to programming version control is such an important part of the job because it allows developers to be more efficient at, well, developing. Especially considering programmers often work in group settings where files filed with code and many different versions of a program gets passed around and changed, and a version control system then comes to be a great help and almost a necessity.  </p>

                <span class="text-muted">CVCSs vs. DVCSs</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">When it comes to version control systems, there is not just any one type. These systems are usually divided into “centralized” and “distributed” system types. Centralized version control systems, or CVCSs, means that there is a server in some “central” location that is housing your files or your project and any changes that you commit to it. This is great because it can keep the different versions of your project so that you don’t have to, and then you can just grab the project versions as you need them. An issue with this type of control system is what happens if anything happens to that server? You may be out of luck when it comes to retrieving your project. This is where distributed version control systems come into play. DVCSs, like Git, enable to “distribute” all of those different versions of your project onto one’s own hard drive, so now the collaborate project isn’t reliant on that central server anymore. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Local and Remote</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control and its ability to organize file/project versions is amazingly useful, but what goes on behind the scenes of this process? Where are these file versions stored? Basically, VCSs are all about the repositories and how they are utilized. Repositories are places that these versions are stored, and when it comes down to it there are two: the local and remote repository. The local repository is the local computer or workspace that the files are being worked on, and for the most part, houses one’s own version work and, with a DVCS, its history. A remote repository is the “other”, separate place that these files get stored that is accessible by the rest of the group or team so that they might commit their own work to or bring down someone else’s to work on. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">The Process Basics</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">The basics of a DVCS, like Git, that make it so useful is the process files take to get from the local repositories to the remote repositories and then back again. With these systems you can save your file or whole project just how it is and send it to the remote repository by adding it to a staging area, committing it to your local repository and then pushing it to the remote one. That version, just how it is, is now snapshotted and saved. From here you can either start with a new file to save to the remote repository or clone a previous version of a file from the remote repository and work on that to be saved next.  </p>
